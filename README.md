🔥 MatterFuzz
Welcome to MatterFuzz, a Python-based fuzzing tool designed to test IoT devices using the Matter protocol for potential Denial of Service (DoS) or crashes. This tool generates and mutates valid Matter protocol messages, sends them to IoT devices, and detects any abnormal behavior.

🚀 Installation
To get started with MatterFuzz, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:

bash
코드 복사
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MatterFuzz.git
cd MatterFuzz
Install the required dependencies:

bash
코드 복사
pip install -r requirements.txt
💻 Usage
Here's how you can start fuzzing your IoT devices using MatterFuzz:

Configure Target IP: Set the IP address of your target IoT device (e.g., Tapo Plug) in the fuzz.py file:

python
코드 복사
target_device_ip = "192.168.1.100"  # Replace with your device's IP
Run the Fuzzer:

bash
코드 복사
python fuzz.py
View Results:

Logs will be stored in the results/logs/ directory.
Any crashes or abnormal behavior will be saved in results/crashes/.

🚦 Fuzzing Trigger
MatterFuzz uses mutation-based fuzzing to alter valid Matter protocol messages and test device responses.

Mutation-based fuzzing: Generates valid messages and randomly mutates them to simulate unexpected input.
Crash Detection: If a device fails to respond or behaves abnormally (DoS or crash), the fuzzer logs the faulty message in the crashes/ folder.
Triggers for DoS or crashes may include:

Unresponsive Device: No response from the IoT device.
Unexpected Behavior: Device reboots, becomes slow, or stops functioning normally.
🛠️ How It Works
MatterFuzz follows these core steps:

Message Generation:
The fuzzer generates valid Matter protocol messages using the format defined in matter_protocol.py.

Message Mutation:
Each generated message is slightly altered using random mutation techniques to create unpredictable input for the device.

Device Interaction:
The mutated message is sent to the target device (e.g., Tapo Plug), and the response is recorded.

Response Analysis:
If the device crashes or becomes unresponsive, the message is saved in the crashes/ folder for further analysis.
